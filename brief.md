## Relevant content for inspiration
The energy equivalent of 8 nuclear power plants is wasted every year.

Wasted. Literally. Cable in the ground. Gone.

In the US 7 GWh of energy is wasted every year.
In South America 6 GWh of energy is wasted every year.
In Europe – 2 GWh of energy is wasted every year.

And AI companies complain there's an energy crunch.

Let's fix this!
